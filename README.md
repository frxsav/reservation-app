# Reservation App

I made this mostly to test Prisma with Supabase and some other little things.
On the website you can:
* Register a new user with _**Client**_ or _**Staff**_ role if you have an _**Admin**_ user to do it.
* Make a reservation.
* See and handle reservations with a _**Staff**_ or _**Admin**_ user.

_Staff and Client users are written below._

## Installation

No need to install anything, the project is running [here](https://reservation-app-puce.vercel.app/login).

## Usage

Here what you can do on the website:

```bash
* Login as a client user (email: visitatore@yopmail.com - pwd: Visitatore123_) and make a reservation.
* Login as a staff user (email: staff@yopmail.com - pwd: Staff123_) to see and handle the reservations.

You can't register a new user without an Admin user which is not public.
To test it you can download the project, set up your own database and create the user.
```
